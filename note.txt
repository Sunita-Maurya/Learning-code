psudocode for polyfill of array filter method
- method create
- attach method to Array prototype object
- method will receive only a callback function
- we will create a resultant array to final return
- we will iterate till the length of array
- call the callback function in the loop with current value
- check the return value of callback
- if true then push element in an array
- return array

array reduce method working
-reduce method accept two argument first is callback second is initialValue wichever you want which is optional
-if you give initialValue then at first time assign  in accumulator and in the current value arr[0] in not gives initialValue then accumulator arr[0] and currentValue is arr[1]


psudocode for polyfill of array reduce method
- attach method to Array prototype object
- method will receive  a callback function and initialValue
-if initialValue exist then assign initialValue  to the accumulator and arr[0] value assign in currentValue
-if not exist initialValue then arr[0] value assign to accumulator arr[1] value assign to currentValue

psudocode for split polyfill of array reduce method
- attach method to string prototype object
-method will receive two paramenter one is separator and second is limit which is optional.
-we will create a result array becouse of it returs a Array.
-we will iterate string and remove that element which is getting in the paramenter
-and push the element in an array
-if given limit then include only element number of limit and lefted element will exclude
